# 🍔 React Learning Project - Inspired by Swiggy 🚀

This project is a hands-on learning experience with **React**, exploring key concepts like **JSX, components, reconciliation, fragments, hooks, Redux store**, and more. To make learning more practical, I am building a **Swiggy-inspired application** using its **public API** to fetch real-time restaurant data.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **React + Vite** ⚡ (Fast development with Hot Module Replacement)
- **React Hooks** 🎣 (State & Effect management)
- **React Router** 🛤️ (Navigation between pages)
- **Redux Store** 📦 (State management)
- **ESLint & Prettier** ✨ (Code formatting & linting)
- **Tailwind CSS** 🎨 (Styling)
- **Swiggy API** 🍽️ (Fetching real-world data)

## 📌 Key Concepts Covered
- 🔹 **JSX** - How JSX works under the hood  
- 🔹 **React Reconciliation** - Understanding the virtual DOM and how React updates the UI efficiently  
- 🔹 **React Fragments** - Using fragments instead of unnecessary div wrappers  
- 🔹 **Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback)** - Managing component state and side effects  
- 🔹 **Redux Store & State Management** - Handling global state with Redux Toolkit  
- 🔹 **Lazy Loading & Code Splitting** - Optimizing performance  
- 🔹 **Online/Offline Tracking** - Detecting user’s internet connectivity status and updating UI accordingly
